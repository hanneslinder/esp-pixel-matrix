This directory contains pre-build binaries for the `esp32 doit devkit v1` board. (That's what I use for this project)

`firmware.bin` is the esp32 code
`spiffs.bin` contains the file system image that includes the browser based react application

Please be aware that you need to flash both files!

Once you have flashed the files, you should be able to access the captive portal and use it to connect to your wifi.
