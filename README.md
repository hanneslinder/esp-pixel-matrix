## Setup

### web app

- install dependencies with `npm i`
- rename `config.example.ts` file to `config.ts`
- `npm run debug` for local development
- For local development: Update esp32 IP adress in `webpack.config.dev.js`
- `npm run build` to build the project

You should now be able to navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser. If the ESP32 is already setup and running you should be able to control the matrix now.

### ESP-32

The esp32 code uses [platformIO](https://platformio.org/)

- install dependencies
- wire up the esp
- take contents of `browser/dist` folder and copy into `esp32/data` directory.
- copy data onto esp32 via platformIO `build file system image` and `upload file system image`.

When power is connected, the ESP32 creates a WIFI hotspot and displays the connection settings on the matrix. Connect to this network and use the WIFI portal to configure your WIFI settings. The ESP32 then reboots and trys to connect to the configured WIFI. On subsequent reboots, the matrix will show its IP address for 10 seconds before switching to its regular mode.

### OTA updates

Once the matrix is up and running you can update the web app and the ESP32 code via OTA updates.
In the `settings` section of the web interface there is an upload form for OTA update data. This form expects 2 files to be uploaded:
`spiffs.bin` and `firmware.bin`

`spiffs.bin`: contains the web app and can be build via platformIO -> `Build File System Image`
(The web app build process should already copy the built artifacts to the `/esp32/data` directory, which is then used for building the file system image)

`firmware.bin`: contains the esp32 code and can be build via platformIO -> `Build`

The output of both commands sould be located in the `.pio/build/wemos_d1_mini32` folder (`wemos_d1_mini32` might be different if you use another device as build target)

Just upload both files in the web UI. After successful upload the device reboots itself and should have the new code. In theory there should be a rollback mechanism for botched updates included but I've not tried this. So best to not unplug the power while flashing a new firmware :)

Please note that your ESP32 needs the `ota.csv` partition layout!

### pre-build files

In the `bin` directory you can find a pre-build firmware and file system image, suitable for `esp32doit-devkit-v1`. Please note that these files probably won't work with other esp32 boards! If you have another board and cannot build these files yourself, please open an issue and I will add them!

### wire up

This project uses the excellent https://github.com/mrfaptastic/ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-I2S-DMA library. If you are unsure how to connect, there is a nice connection guide there.
In short:

```
  HUB 75 PANEL         ESP 32 PIN
+----------+
|  R1  G1  |    R1  -> IO25    G1 -> IO26
|  B1  GND |    B1  -> IO27
|  R2  G2  |    R2  -> IO14    G2 -> IO12
|  B2  E   |    B2  -> IO13     E -> N/A (required for 1/32 scan panels, like 64x64. Any available pin would do, i.e. IO32 )
|   A  B   |    A   -> IO23     B -> IO19
|   C  D   |    C   -> IO05     D -> IO17
| CLK  LAT |    CLK -> IO16   LAT -> IO 4
|  OE  GND |    OE  -> IO15   GND -> ESP32 GND
+----------+
```

There is also a Gerber file located in the `hardware` folder for a PCB to simplify the connection.

### print the case

You can find `STL` and `STEP` files for the case inside the `hardware` folder.
The case should fit a standard 64x32 pixel p3 led matrix.
I've designed the case to use M3 threaded inserts for all screw holes.
For power I've used a micro usb breakout board like this one: https://www.amazon.de/WayinTop-Breakout-Konverter-Netzteil-Steckbrett/dp/B07W13X3TD/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3BRR55R6O73B7&keywords=usb+power+breakout&qid=1652083140&sprefix=usb+power+breakout%2Caps%2C88&sr=8-3
